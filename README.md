# EXAM_FORM_SUBMISSION_SYSTEM
===============================
This Exam Form Submission is in PHP, CSS, JavaScript, and bootstrap. Talking about the features of this online system, it contains both the admin section and the user section. The user can log in to select the exam he/she wants to appear in, while the admin can view all users, their participation, and manage subjects. The design of this project is pretty simple so that the user wonâ€™t find any difficulties while working on it.
